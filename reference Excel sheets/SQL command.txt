DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index


If you want to select all the fields(columns) available in the table,

SELECT * FROM table_name;

Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from.

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;


The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to
list the different (distinct) values.

SELECT DISTINCT

The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
used in the Where clause:
=	Equal	
>	Greater than	
<	Less than	
>=	Greater than or equal	
<=	Less than or equal	
<>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=	
BETWEEN	Between a certain range	
LIKE	Search for a pattern	
IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column


The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.

The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:

The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.

example

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;

The ORDER BY used :To sorts the records in ascending order by default
			:To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.


It is possible to write the INSERT INTO statement in two ways:

1. Specify both the column names(a,b,c) and the values(x,y,z) to be inserted:
2. If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, no need to specify the column names in the SQL query.
   note:order of the values should be in the same order as the columns in the table.


A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. 
A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!


The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
Note: Be careful when updating records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement. 
The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be updated. 
If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!
