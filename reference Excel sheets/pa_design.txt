[v0.1]
read xlsx file every n minutes - poc (proof of concept) / prototype
find course/groups that changed
assign above to chngd_course_lst

read xlsx file every n minutes - poc (proof of concept) / prototype

check file (.xlsx) for changes
if changed:

loop on xl every T seconds
multiple datatable comparison too complex for current scenario
instead use large delay for now (12h, 24h)
for each row in dt0:
  for each cell

[v0.2.6]
loop on xl every T seconds
  - read timetable into datatable
nested for loop monstrously complicated
instead use columnar structure in excel (DONE)
gmail broadcast from excel names (TODO)
  - module 1 (name: mailer)
    - read column from excel
    - send mail to all email ids in column
excel filesystem data model is finally satisfactory
  - directory to contain 1 xlsx per course (sheets: email,etc,etc)
